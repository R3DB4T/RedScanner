# RedScanner
This is my first Python Program ever, It consists of a Port Scanner that scans your chosen IP Address. I Don't really master coding but I try to learn as many things related to ethical hacking and pentesting as possible :)
I welcome any recommendations or reviews. Thank you.

To use the tool, run this command in the terminal:
cd {/path/to/RedScannner}
python3 redscanner.py 

voila :D
